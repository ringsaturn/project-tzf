By default, project-tzf's code are licensed under the MIT license.
And tzf-rel, tzf-rel-lite's data are licensed under ODbL license, same as upstream [`evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder`](https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder).

But for tzf/tzf-rs/tzfpy, a license named "Anti CSDN License" is applied, which is used to prevent use of the code in CSDN, has no effect on other use cases.
